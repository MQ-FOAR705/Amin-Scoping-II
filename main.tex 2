\section{Goal}

I am focusing specifically on one aspect of my research process, the sifting through multiple documents for the purpose of finding key terms and ideas and then organizing them into a unified narrative. The single solvable problem I am addressing from Scoping 1 is the process of gathering and then sifting through multiple documents with ease. I want to make the computer do as many of the mechanical, computable tasks as possible.

\section{Decomposition}

The process of finding and organising relevant documents goes as follows:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Search for key terms in relevant database
    \item Read abstracts of top hits
    \item Download most relevant looking papers based on key words, sentences, and themes
    \item Place all similar papers into the same folder
    \item Skim through the most seemingly relevant papers and read the bibliography and references
    \item Search again, this time based on the referenced names and ideas in the initial batch of downloaded papers
    \item Repeat the above steps until I have found an acceptable number of relevant papers
    \item Sort papers into various documents for ease of access
    \item Read each paper in order of seeming relevance, finding common and unique themes across the set of papers
    \item Take note of which papers contain which arguments
\end{itemize}

\section{Pattern Recognition}

The patterns I am going to focus on are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finding specific words and sentences within and across different papers
    \item Collecting and organizing papers into a single bibliographic database in such a way that I can search for papers based on a theme

\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithm Design}

The algorithm is made up of three chunks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finding key words across multiple papers
    \item Organizing papers
    \item Categorizing papers

\end{itemize}
I wish to have a process of easily accessing multiple kinds of paper on a topic I am interested in in any given moment.
